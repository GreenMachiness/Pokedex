# Pokédex React App

Your task is to build a Pokédex app using React that allows users to browse and search for Pokémon using the Pokémon API (https://pokeapi.co). The app should display information about each Pokémon, including its name, image, type(s), abilities, and other relevant details.

# API Documentation: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon

# Requirements:

- Use React to build the app.
- Retrieve Pokémon data from the Pokémon API (https://pokeapi.co) using  HTTP fetch requests.
- Display a list of Pokémon on the main page, showing their names and images.
- Include the details about a Pokémon such as name, image, type(s), abilities, height, weight, and any other relevant details.
- Implement error handling for API requests, displaying a friendly message to the user if something goes wrong.
- Add some styling and make the app visually appealing using CSS

## After learning React Router
- Clicking on a Pokémon in the list should display its detailed information on a separate page.

## Bonus (optional):
- Implement a search feature that allows users to search for Pokémon by name or ID.
- Implement additional features such as sorting Pokémon by name, type, or other criteria.
- Add animations, transitions, and sound to enhance the user experience.
- Include a feature to mark favorite Pokémon and persist the data using local storage.
